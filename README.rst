Catalyst is an algorithmic trading library for crypto-assets written in Python.
It allows trading strategies to be easily expressed and backtested against 
historical data (with daily and minute resolution), providing analytics and 
insights regarding a particular strategy's performance. 

Catalyst empowers users to share and curate data and build profitable, data-driven investment strategies.

This is the unofficial fork of the Catalyst project, as the original seems to have been abandoned by
the Enigma team.

PR's with fixes are welcome.
